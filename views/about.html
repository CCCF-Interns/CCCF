                    <p>What began as a small circle of parents seeking connection has grown into a compassionate foundation built on shared resilience. Each family we meet shapes our path—teaching us that care is not only treatment, but presence, understanding, and continuity.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, we have partnered with caregivers, educators, health professionals, and volunteers to create a network that wraps around the child and uplifts the entire family. Our story is still being written—one act of kindness, one breakthrough, one smile at a time.</p>
